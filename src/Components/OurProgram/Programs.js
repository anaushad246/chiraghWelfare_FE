The installation of hand pumps will benefit villagers in meeting their basic need for water. Together, we can secure safer water sources. We focus on the most affected areas to tackle water poverty by providing people with crucial amenities like hand pumps. We believe that everyone should be able to access clean water, and this access underpins all other aspects of development. These initiatives have gone a long way in improving the lives of many people across India.`,
